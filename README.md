# 📊 VBA Excel GUI – Process Automation Tool

This project is an **Excel-based VBA GUI** built to automate a previously manual and repetitive workflow.  
Instead of engineers repeatedly **copy-pasting data between files**, the GUI allows users to **select a process title and type**, after which the relevant data is automatically displayed and prepared for export.

The goal was **simplicity, speed, and ease of use** within a familiar tool — Microsoft Excel.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Before this tool, engineers had to:
- Manually locate the correct data
- Copy and paste values between Excel files
- Repeat the same steps for different process types

This was:
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Inefficient for repeated daily use  

The VBA GUI was created to **automate this process end-to-end**, while keeping the workflow entirely inside Excel.

---

## 👷 Designed for Engineers

The GUI was designed to:
- Run **directly inside Excel**
- Use **simple dropdowns and buttons**
- Avoid exposing complex formulas or macros to the user

Engineers only need to:
1. Select the **process title**
2. Select the **process type**
3. View the automatically populated data in the worksheet

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User opens the Excel file containing the VBA GUI  
2. Selects:
   - Process title  
   - Process type  
3. VBA logic retrieves the relevant data
4. Data is automatically:
   - Displayed in a structured Excel sheet  
   - Ready for review, filtering, or formatting  
5. Output can be **exported to another Excel file** if needed

No manual copying or pasting is required.
